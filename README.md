# Plant-Moisture-Monitor
This project involves building a soil moisture monitor using an Arduino and an ESP8266 WiFi module. The monitor reads soil moisture levels and sends an email alert when the moisture level falls below a specified threshold. This helps in ensuring that your plants are adequately watered.
